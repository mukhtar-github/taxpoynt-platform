## Test Case Documentation Template

For each test case, document:

1. **Test ID**: Unique identifier (e.g., AUTH-001)
2. **Test Name**: Descriptive name
3. **Module**: Component being tested
4. **Description**: What the test validates
5. **Preconditions**: Required setup
6. **Test Steps**: Numbered steps to execute
7. **Expected Results**: What should happen
8. **Actual Results**: What actually happened (during execution)
9. **Status**: Pass/Fail/Blocked
10. **Environment**: Where test was executed
11. **Date**: When test was last executed

## Continuous Integration Testing

Implement GitHub Actions workflows for:

1. **On Pull Request**:
   - Run linting
   - Run unit tests
   - Check code coverage
   - Run security scans
   - Build application

2. **On Merge to Main**:
