# Railway FastAPI Authentication Redirect Loop Solutions

Railway's proxy infrastructure causes 301 redirect loops with FastAPI authentication middleware due to a combination of mandatory HTTPS enforcement, proxy header handling issues, and FastAPI's default trailing slash redirects. **The primary fix is disabling FastAPI's automatic redirects and properly configuring uvicorn for Railway's proxy environment.**

Railway runs all applications behind an Envoy-based edge proxy that automatically enforces HTTPS with 301 redirects and injects specific headers (X-Forwarded-Proto, X-Envoy-External-Address, X-Forwarded-Host). When FastAPI's authentication dependencies trigger additional 307 redirects for trailing slashes, this creates redirect loops where POST requests become GET requests, causing authentication failures.

## Core problem identification

The redirect loop occurs through this sequence: Client sends authenticated POST request → Railway proxy enforces HTTPS (301) → FastAPI redirects for trailing slash (307) → Authentication headers lost → Process repeats infinitely. This specifically affects routes with `Depends(get_current_user)` because they're more sensitive to method changes and header preservation during redirects.

**Railway's specific proxy behavior** includes mandatory HTTPS enforcement that cannot be disabled, automatic header injection that can be spoofed by clients, and domain-based routing that handles Railway-generated domains (.up.railway.app) more reliably than custom domains. The platform uses X-Envoy-External-Address as the preferred header for client IP detection, which differs from standard X-Forwarded-For patterns.

## Essential configuration fixes

### FastAPI application configuration
The most critical fix is disabling automatic trailing slash redirects:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from starlette.middleware.base import BaseHTTPMiddleware

# Primary fix: disable redirect loops
app = FastAPI(redirect_slashes=False)

# Essential proxy header middleware (must be first)
class ProxyFixMiddleware(BaseHTTPMiddleware):
    async def dispatch(self, request, call_next):
        # Handle Railway's specific headers
        if request.headers.get("x-envoy-external-address"):
            request.scope["client"] = (
                request.headers["x-envoy-external-address"], 0
            )
        
        # Fix scheme for HTTPS redirects
        if request.headers.get("x-forwarded-proto"):
            request.scope["scheme"] = request.headers["x-forwarded-proto"]
        
        return await call_next(request)

app.add_middleware(ProxyFixMiddleware)
```

### Railway deployment configuration
Your railway.toml requires specific uvicorn flags for proxy compatibility:

```toml
[build]
builder = "nixpacks"

[deploy]
startCommand = "uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT --proxy-headers --forwarded-allow-ips '*'"
healthcheckPath = "/api/v1/health/ready"
```

The `--proxy-headers` and `--forwarded-allow-ips '*'` flags are essential for Railway's proxy infrastructure. Railway automatically provides the PORT environment variable, and binding to 0.0.0.0 ensures IPv4 compatibility with Railway's internal routing.

### Environment variables setup
Set these critical variables in Railway's dashboard:

```bash
FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS=*
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-change-this
TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS=true
```

Railway automatically injects RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT and PORT variables. The FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS=* setting tells uvicorn to trust Railway's proxy headers, which is essential for proper HTTPS redirect handling.

## Authentication middleware solutions

### Dependency injection pattern (recommended)
Use FastAPI's `Depends()` pattern rather than global middleware for authentication:

```python
from fastapi import Depends, HTTPException, Request
from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer

oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(tokenUrl="token", auto_error=False)

async def get_current_user(
    request: Request,
    token: str = Depends(oauth2_scheme)
):
    if not token:
        # Handle Railway's cookie fallback
        token = request.cookies.get("access_token")
    
    if not token:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Not authenticated")
    
    # Your token validation logic
    return validate_token(token)

# Apply to specific routes
@app.get("/api/v1/firs-certification/status")
async def get_status(user = Depends(get_current_user)):
    return {"status": "authenticated", "user": user}
```

This approach avoids the middleware ordering issues that cause redirect loops and provides better control over authentication requirements per route.

### OAuth callback handling for Railway
OAuth callbacks need special handling for Railway's proxy environment:

```python
@app.get("/auth/callback")
async def oauth_callback(request: Request, code: str):
    # Build correct redirect URI for Railway
    base_url = str(request.base_url)
    if 'railway.app' in str(request.url):
        base_url = base_url.replace('http://', 'https://')
    
    redirect_uri = f"{base_url}/auth/callback"
    
    # Exchange code for token with correct URI
    token_response = await exchange_oauth_code(code, redirect_uri)
    return {"access_token": token_response["access_token"]}
```

Railway's proxy can cause OAuth redirect URI mismatches, so explicitly handling the HTTPS scheme ensures callbacks work correctly.

## Railway-specific troubleshooting

### Proxy header validation
Railway injects specific headers that need proper handling:

```python
def get_client_ip(request: Request) -> str:
    # Railway's preferred header
    client_ip = request.headers.get("x-envoy-external-address")
    if client_ip:
        return client_ip
    
    # Fallback to standard header
    x_forwarded_for = request.headers.get("x-forwarded-for")
    if x_forwarded_for:
        return x_forwarded_for.split(",")[0].strip()
    
    return request.client.host
```

**Security note**: X-Forwarded-Host can be spoofed by clients and should not be trusted for authentication decisions. Always use X-Envoy-External-Address when available on Railway.

### HTTPS enforcement handling
Railway's mandatory HTTPS enforcement requires applications to handle scheme reconstruction properly:

```python
@app.middleware("http")
async def https_redirect_middleware(request: Request, call_next):
    forwarded_proto = request.headers.get("x-forwarded-proto")
    
    # Only redirect if specifically needed
    if forwarded_proto == "http" and "railway.app" in str(request.url):
        url = str(request.url).replace("http://", "https://", 1)
        return RedirectResponse(url=url, status_code=301)
    
    return await call_next(request)
```

However, in most cases, Railway's automatic HTTPS enforcement handles this transparently, making custom redirect middleware unnecessary.

## Working deployment pattern

Here's a complete working configuration that prevents redirect loops:

```python
# main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, Request
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
import uvicorn
import os

# Critical: disable redirect_slashes
app = FastAPI(
    title="FIRS Certification API",
    redirect_slashes=False
)

# Proxy middleware (first in chain)
@app.middleware("http")
async def railway_proxy_middleware(request: Request, call_next):
    if os.getenv("RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT"):
        if request.headers.get("x-envoy-external-address"):
            request.scope["client"] = (
                request.headers["x-envoy-external-address"], 0
            )
        
        if request.headers.get("x-forwarded-proto"):
            request.scope["scheme"] = request.headers["x-forwarded-proto"]
    
    return await call_next(request)

# CORS configuration
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],  # Restrict in production
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

# Your routes with authentication
@app.get("/api/v1/health/ready")
async def health_check():
    return {"status": "healthy"}

@app.get("/api/v1/firs-certification/verify")
async def verify_certification(user = Depends(get_current_user)):
    return {"status": "verified", "user": user.username}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(
        "main:app",
        host="0.0.0.0",
        port=int(os.environ.get("PORT", 8000)),
        proxy_headers=True,
        forwarded_allow_ips="*"
    )
```

## Debugging checklist

When troubleshooting Railway redirect loops:

**Check Railway logs** for redirect patterns: `railway logs --tail` and look for sequences of 301/307 status codes indicating redirect loops.

**Verify proxy headers** are being handled correctly by adding temporary debug middleware to log incoming headers.

**Test authentication flows** specifically on Railway's environment, as local development may not reproduce the proxy behavior.

**Monitor OAuth callback URLs** to ensure they use HTTPS scheme and correct Railway domain.

**Validate middleware order** - proxy handling must come before authentication middleware to prevent header conflicts.

The combination of disabling FastAPI's automatic redirects, proper uvicorn proxy configuration, and Railway-aware header handling resolves the authentication redirect loops while maintaining security and functionality. The key insight is that Railway's proxy infrastructure requires applications to trust forwarded headers and handle HTTPS scheme reconstruction correctly.
