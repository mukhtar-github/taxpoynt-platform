  - [ ] Check format compliance
  - [ ] Verify hash matches invoice content
  - [ ] Test with various invoice scenarios

#### CSID Implementation:
- [ ] Implement cryptographic signing of invoices
  - [ ] Create key management functions

### Days 5-7: FIRS Submission Functionality

#### API Client Tasks:
- [ ] Create FIRS API connector for sandbox environment
  - [ ] Implement authentication with FIRS API
  - [ ] Create submission endpoints for invoices
  - [ ] Add response handling and error management

#### Status Tracking:
- [ ] Implement invoice submission status tracking
  - [ ] Create database models for tracking submissions
  - [ ] Add status update functions
  - [ ] Implement webhook handler for status notifications

#### Error Handling:
- [ ] Add retry mechanism for failed submissions
  - [ ] Implement exponential backoff
  - [ ] Create failure logging
  - [ ] Add alert system for critical failures

## Week 2: Polish and Deployment

### Days 1-2: Dashboard Enhancements

#### Core Dashboard Functions:
- [ ] Create basic monitoring dashboard
  - [ ] Add invoice processing metrics
  - [ ] Create status visualizations
  - [ ] Implement filtering by date and status

#### API Status Visualization:
- [ ] Add integration status indicators
  - [ ] Show Odoo connection status
  - [ ] Display FIRS API status
  - [ ] Visualize submission success/failure rates

### Days 3-4: Deployment Configuration

#### Railway Backend Deployment:
- [ ] Configure Railway environment
  - [ ] Set environment variables
  - [ ] Configure database connections
  - [ ] Set up API security

#### Vercel Frontend Deployment:
- [ ] Configure Vercel build settings
  - [ ] Set environment variables
  - [ ] Configure API endpoints
  - [ ] Set up CORS and security headers

#### Testing Deployed Environment:
- [ ] Perform end-to-end testing in live environment
  - [ ] Test Odoo integration
  - [ ] Validate IRN generation
  - [ ] Test FIRS submission

### Days 5-7: Documentation and Demo Preparation

#### Technical Documentation:
- [ ] Create API documentation
  - [ ] Document endpoints
  - [ ] Add request/response examples
  - [ ] Document authentication methods

#### Demo Materials:
- [ ] Create demo script for stakeholder presentation
  - [ ] Outline key features to demonstrate
  - [ ] Create test data for presentation
  - [ ] Prepare fallback scenarios

#### User Guide:
- [ ] Create basic user guide for the system
  - [ ] Document configuration steps
  - [ ] Create usage instructions
  - [ ] Add troubleshooting section

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Valid E-Invoice Production**: Ensure the system generates e-invoices that pass FIRS validation
2. **End-to-End Flow**: Complete the entire process from Odoo data extraction to FIRS submission
3. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling throughout the process
4. **Deployment**: Ensure the system is accessible via Railway and Vercel for stakeholder testing

## Implementation Strategy with APP Integration

### How to Proceed

1. **Complete your 2-week MVP first** - Focus on delivering the core SI functionality outlined in this plan to ensure a working end-to-end solution for stakeholder presentation.

2. **Incorporate minimal APP elements if time permits** - If you have remaining time within your 2-week window, add simple APP indicators to your UI to show where these features will be integrated:
   - Add placeholder certificate management card on dashboard
   - Include simple APP status indicators in the navigation
   - Add basic APP information in the documentation

3. **Use the APP addendum for planning the next phase** - After completing the MVP, use the [APP Implementation Addendum](app_implementation_addendum.md) to guide the implementation of APP functionality in the subsequent phases.

## Next Steps After Initial Implementation

- Implement batch processing for B2C invoices
- Begin implementation of core APP functionality (certificate management, cryptographic stamping)
- Add advanced reporting features
- Enhance security features beyond MVP requirements
- Create admin interface for system management
- Update business landing page to highlight dual SI/APP capabilities
