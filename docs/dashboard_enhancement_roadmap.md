# TaxPoynt eInvoice Dashboard Enhancement Roadmap

## Overview

This document outlines planned enhancements to the TaxPoynt eInvoice dashboard following the completion of the initial 2-week MVP implementation. These features will build upon the foundation established in the MVP to provide more comprehensive monitoring, analytics, and proactive management capabilities.

## Alignment with Integration Strategy

These enhancements align with our ERP-first integration strategy, with particular focus on Odoo integration metrics while providing infrastructure for expanding to additional integration types as outlined in the [systems integration recommendation](./systems_integration_recommendation.md).

## Phase 1: Advanced Metrics & Comparison (Week 3-4)

### Integration Type Comparison

**Priority: High**  
**Estimated Effort: 3 days**

Implement comparative metrics across different integration types to provide insights into performance differences and help identify optimization opportunities.

#### Backend Implementation:
- Create `get_integration_type_metrics` method in `SubmissionMetricsService`
- Add endpoint `/dashboard/submission/integration-metrics` to submission dashboard routes
- Implement aggregation queries for integration-specific metrics

#### Frontend Implementation:
- Add `fetchIntegrationTypeMetrics` function to submission dashboard service
- Create "All Integrations" tab in the dashboard
- Implement comparison table and visualization charts
- Add filtering by time range and organization

### Historical Trend Analysis

**Priority: Medium**  
**Estimated Effort: 2 days**

Extend dashboard to provide deeper historical trend analysis with improved visualizations and statistical insights.

#### Backend Implementation:
- Enhance metrics calculation to include month-over-month and quarter-over-quarter comparisons
- Add trend calculation and anomaly detection

#### Frontend Implementation:
- Create trend visualization components
- Add predictive indicators for submission volume and success rates
- Implement exportable reports for historical data

## Phase 2: Alert System (Week 4-5)

### Configurable Alert Thresholds

**Priority: High**  
**Estimated Effort: 4 days**

Implement a robust alerting system based on configurable thresholds to proactively identify issues with invoice submissions.

#### Backend Implementation:
- Create `AlertThreshold` model in database
- Implement `AlertService` with threshold checking logic
- Add background task for regular alert evaluation
- Implement notification delivery (email, Slack)

#### Frontend Implementation:
- Create alert configuration interface
- Add alert status visualization to dashboard
- Implement alert history and acknowledgment tracking
- Add alert testing capabilities

### Critical Failure Monitoring

**Priority: High**  
**Estimated Effort: 2 days**

Enhance monitoring of critical failures with detailed diagnostics and actionable insights.

#### Backend Implementation:
- Extend error tracking with severity classification
- Implement pattern recognition for recurring errors
- Create diagnostic endpoints for detailed error analysis

#### Frontend Implementation:
- Add critical failure monitoring panel to dashboard
- Implement guided troubleshooting for common errors
- Create visualization for error correlations

## Phase 3: User Experience Enhancements (Week 5-6)

### Dashboard Personalization

**Priority: Medium**  
**Estimated Effort: 3 days**

Allow users to customize their dashboard view based on their specific monitoring needs.

#### Implementation:
- Create user preference storage for dashboard configuration
- Implement drag-and-drop dashboard component arrangement
- Add configurable default views and saved layouts
- Create role-based default dashboards

### Real-time Monitoring

**Priority: Medium**  
**Estimated Effort: 2 days**

Add real-time updates to dashboard metrics without requiring manual refresh.

#### Implementation:
- Implement WebSocket connections for live metric updates
- Add visual indicators for recently changed metrics
- Create activity feed for important events
- Implement notification system for threshold violations

## Future Considerations

### Integration with External Analytics

Explore integration with external analytics platforms like Datadog or New Relic for more sophisticated monitoring.

### Mobile Dashboard View

Optimize dashboard for mobile viewing to enable on-the-go monitoring.

### Machine Learning Insights

Investigate potential for ML-driven insights to predict submission issues before they occur.

## Implementation Strategy

1. Prioritize enhancements that directly support the core ERP-first integration strategy
2. Focus first on features that provide actionable insights to improve submission success rates
3. Implement features in modular fashion to allow for incremental deployment
4. Maintain backward compatibility with existing dashboard components

## Success Metrics

The success of these enhancements will be measured by:

1. Improved submission success rates
2. Reduction in time to identify and resolve issues
3. Increased user engagement with monitoring tools
4. Positive feedback from key stakeholders
