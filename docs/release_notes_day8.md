# Day 8 Release Notes – Launch Readiness Buffer

## Highlights

- ✅ Synthetic observability regression (`platform/tests/integration/test_observability_synthetic.py`) issues FIRS-style traffic through the `ObservabilityMiddleware` to confirm Prometheus metrics and analytics hooks fire for alert thresholds.
- ✅ Micro-interaction polish: verification CTA retains the "Saved at" status chip and checklist copy now reflects completion state; no UI regression identified.
- ✅ Dashboard review: Prometheus + OpenTelemetry hooks confirmed via synthetic run; no missing panels reported.
- ✅ Rollback strategy documented with mitigation steps and release-monitoring window.
