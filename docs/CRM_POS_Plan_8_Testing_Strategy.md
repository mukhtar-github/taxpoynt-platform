# TaxPoynt CRM & POS Integration - Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the testing approach for the CRM and POS integration implementation. The testing strategy ensures comprehensive validation of functionality, security, and performance across all integration points.

## Testing Levels

### 1. Unit Testing

- **Coverage Target**: >85% for all new code
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Base connector functionality
  - Authentication mechanisms
  - Data transformation logic
  - Error handling

### 2. Integration Testing

- **Coverage Target**: Key integration flows
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Authentication flows with external platforms
  - Webhook handling and validation
  - End-to-end data flow from platform to invoice

### 3. Performance Testing

- **Benchmarks**:
  - POS Transaction Processing: <2s end-to-end
  - API Response Time: <500ms (95th percentile)
  - Webhook Processing: <1s acknowledgment
  - Queue Processing: <5s for standard priority

## Test Automation

- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated tests run on every PR
- **Nightly Tests**: Full integration test suite runs nightly
- **Load Tests**: Weekly load tests with simulated traffic

## Test Data Management

- **Mock Services**: Mock implementations of all external APIs
- **Test Fixtures**: Standard dataset for repeatable tests
- **Anonymized Production Data**: For performance testing only

## Security Testing

- **Authentication**: Test all OAuth flows and token handling
- **Data Protection**: Verify credential encryption
- **Access Control**: Validate permission boundaries

## Specialized Testing

### CRM-Specific Tests

- Deal-to-invoice conversion accuracy
- Field mapping validation
- Bidirectional sync verification

### POS-Specific Tests

- High-volume transaction processing
- Real-time processing under load
- Multi-location data handling

## Test Environment

- **Development**: Local environment with mocked services
- **Integration**: Staging with test instances of external APIs
- **Pre-production**: Full environment with production-like data

## Test Documentation

- Test plans: Detailed scenarios for manual validation
- Test reports: Automated summaries of test results
- Coverage reports: Analysis of code coverage

## Defect Management

- **Severity Levels**:
  - Critical: Blocking issue affecting core functionality
  - Major: Significant impact to user experience
  - Minor: Non-critical issue with workaround
  - Cosmetic: Visual or UX improvement

- **Priority Levels**:
  - P0: Fix immediately (production blocker)
  - P1: Fix before release
  - P2: Fix in next sprint
  - P3: Fix when convenient

## Key Test Scenarios

1. **Authentication & Connection**
   - Establish new connections to all supported platforms
   - Handle token refresh and expiration
   - Test invalid credentials and error handling

2. **Data Synchronization**
   - CRM deal import and conversion
   - POS transaction processing
   - Handling of data format variations

3. **Error Handling**
   - API unavailability recovery
   - Rate limit handling
   - Malformed data processing

4. **Performance Under Load**
   - High-volume webhook processing
   - Concurrent transaction handling
   - Database query performance

This testing strategy ensures comprehensive validation of all integration components while maintaining high quality standards throughout the implementation process.
