# Generate IRN
To successfully generate an Invoice Reference Number (IRN) for businesses (taxpayers), the System Integrator (SI) will use three critical data points from the taxpayers’ internal invoicing tools (accounting system) and FIRS-assigned credentials. These data points will be combined to create a unique IRN for each transaction, ensuring secure and traceable invoicing. The details required are as
follows:
1. Invoice Number – The identifier generated by the taxpayer’s accounting system.
- Alphanumeric (combination of letters and numbers)
- No special characters allowed (e.g., !, @, #, $, etc.)
- Example formats: INV001, INV0001, INVOICE123, etc.
2. Service ID – A unique, system-generated identifier assigned to each taxpayer upon successful business enablement.
- Generated by: FIRS e-Invoicing System
- Uniqueness: Unique to each taxpayer
- Format: Alphanumeric (combination of letters and numbers)
- Length: 8 characters
- Example: 94ND90NR
3. Timestamp - The exact date of the invoice issuance.
- YYYYMMDD (year, month, day)
- Numeric only (no dashes, slashes, or special characters)
- Example: 20240611
These three data points are concatenated in the sequence above to generate a unique IRN for each invoice. Ensure all entries meet the outlined format to avoid submission errors.

## Example IRN
INV001-94ND90NR-20240611
This generated IRN ensures a standardized, traceable identifier for each invoice submitted through the FIRS e-lnvoice platform.

## Response Example
Upon successful IRN generation, you'll receive a confirmation response similar to the example below, indicating that the IRN is correctly formatted and recorded. This response will include details of the invoice status, verification timestamp, and other compliance metrics as required by FIRS regulations.
{
"IRN": "INV001-94ND90NR-20240611",
"status": "Valid",
"timestamp": "20240611",
}
