# NDPR Compliance for TaxPoynt eInvoice

## Overview

The Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR) is Nigeria's principal data protection legislation, issued by the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) in January 2019. This document outlines the key requirements and our implementation approach to ensure compliance with NDPR in the TaxPoynt eInvoice system.

## Key NDPR Requirements

### 1. Lawful Processing

**Requirement:**
- Data must be collected and processed lawfully, fairly, and transparently.
- Processing must be necessary for legitimate purposes.

**Implementation:**
- Clear indication of data being collected during user registration
- Explicit consent mechanisms before data collection
- Transparent privacy policy accessible to all users

### 2. Data Subject Rights

**Requirement:**
- Right to access personal data
- Right to rectification of inaccurate data
- Right to deletion ("right to be forgotten")
- Right to restrict processing
- Right to data portability

**Implementation:**
- User profile access and editing functionality
- Account deletion option with clear data retention policies
- Data export functionality for user data portability
- Preference settings to control data usage

### 3. Data Security

**Requirement:**
- Appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect data
- Prevention of unauthorized access
- Protection against alteration, disclosure, or destruction

**Implementation:**
- Password hashing using bcrypt with appropriate complexity requirements
- JWT token-based authentication with appropriate expiration
- TLS/SSL encryption for all API communication
- Database encryption for sensitive fields
- Regular security audits and vulnerability testing

### 4. Data Processing Records

**Requirement:**
- Maintain records of data processing activities
- Document purpose, categories of data, recipients, and security measures

**Implementation:**
- Audit logging of all authentication events
- Tracking of data access and modifications
- Documentation of data flows and processing activities

### 5. Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)

**Requirement:**
- Conduct assessment for high-risk processing activities
- Evaluate necessity and proportionality of processing

**Implementation:**
- DPIA framework for new features involving personal data
- Regular review of existing processing activities

### 6. Data Transfer Limitations

**Requirement:**
- Restrictions on transferring data outside Nigeria without adequate protections

**Implementation:**
- Server location selection with data residency considerations
- Data localization options for sensitive information
- Transfer impact assessments for any cross-border data flows

## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. User Data Handling

- Store only necessary user information:
  - Email address (required for communication)
  - Name (for personalization)
  - Hashed password (never stored in plaintext)
  - Organization/role information (for access control)

- Avoid collecting unnecessary personal identifiers:
  - No national ID numbers unless legally required
  - No biometric data
  - Minimize collection of contact information

### 2. Data Storage and Retention

- Implement retention periods:
  - Active accounts: retain data as long as account is active
  - Inactive accounts: anonymize after 12 months of inactivity
  - Deleted accounts: purge personal data within 30 days

- Data minimization approach:
  - Regular database cleanup processes
  - Anonymization of historical data not needed for operations

### 3. Security Measures

- Authentication:
  - Multi-factor authentication for administrative accounts
  - Password complexity requirements
  - Account lockout after failed attempts
  - Secure password reset process

- Encryption:
  - Encrypt data in transit (TLS 1.2+)
  - Encrypt sensitive data at rest
  - Secure key management system

- Access Control:
  - Role-based access control (RBAC)
  - Principle of least privilege
  - Regular access reviews

## Implementation Timeline

- **Phase 1 (Current POC):**
  - Basic compliance framework
  - Essential security measures
  - Privacy policy documentation

- **Phase 2 (Prototype):**
  - Enhanced user rights management
  - Audit logging implementation
  - Data retention policies

- **Phase 3 (MVP):**
  - Complete DPIA implementation
  - Advanced encryption for all sensitive data
  - Comprehensive compliance documentation
