UI/UX Stack Evaluation and Best Practices
Overview: The project’s frontend stack uses Lucide React icons, native HTML elements (instead of Chakra UI), Shadcn UI components, and a custom Tailwind CSS typography scale. Each choice has trade-offs in usability, performance, accessibility, and maintainability. The sections below critique these choices and offer best-practice guidance for combining them effectively.
Iconography: Lucide React
Usability & Design Consistency: Lucide is a modern, open-source SVG icon set (a fork of Feather) with ~1,500 icons. Its strict design rules yield clean, consistent visuals across all icons​
lucide.dev
. This consistency helps users recognize actions quickly. Icon customization is straightforward: you can adjust color, size, and stroke easily via props or CSS​
lucide.dev
. Lucide’s community backing means the icon library grows and stays up-to-date with design trends.
Performance: Lucide’s icons are SVG-based and lightweight​
lucide.dev
. The library is fully tree-shakable, so only the icons you import are bundled​
lucide.dev
. This keeps the JavaScript payload small, minimizing impact on page load. For example, using individual imports (import { Home } from 'lucide-react') ensures unused icons are omitted, improving bundle size​
lucide.dev
.
Accessibility: By default Lucide icons are decorative SVGs. They need appropriate text alternatives when they convey meaning. Lucide’s guidance is to not attach aria-label to the icon SVG itself, but instead provide an accessible label on the surrounding interactive element (e.g. <button>)​
lucide.dev
. For icon-only buttons, add a visually hidden text label or aria-label on the button. For purely decorative icons, mark them aria-hidden="true". These practices prevent screen reader confusion and meet WCAG standards.
Maintainability: Since Lucide is open-source and actively maintained, it’s a reliable long-term choice. Its React package is stable and widely used, with an active community. Importing icons individually means you control exactly which assets enter your codebase. If a needed icon is missing, Lucide’s extensibility allows custom additions. Alternative icon libraries (Heroicons, FontAwesome, etc.) are heavier or less consistent; Lucide strikes a good balance of breadth and performance​

lucide.dev
.
Best Practices: Use Lucide’s React components with semantic HTML. For example, <Home className="w-6 h-6" /> for a 24px icon. Leverage Tailwind classes to set icon size and color (e.g. className="text-blue-500"). Always test icons with screen readers. If an icon serves as a button, add a hidden label: <button aria-label="Go home"><Home /></button>​
lucide.dev
. This ensures both clarity and performance.
Base Components: Native HTML vs Chakra UI
Usability & Accessibility: The team chose native HTML elements (e.g. <button>, <div>) styled with Tailwind, rather than Chakra UI’s components. This grants full control over markup and semantics. Native elements are lightweight and highly compatible, but put the onus on developers to add ARIA roles and semantic structure. In contrast, Chakra UI’s pre-built components come with many accessibility features out-of-the-box (e.g. form field labeling, focus handling)​
v2.chakra-ui.com
. Chakra’s documentation even notes that Tailwind alone “leaves the user to handle semantic HTML and WAI-ARIA requirements…Chakra provides all these benefits out of the box”​
v2.chakra-ui.com
. The trade-off is that using native elements requires careful adherence to accessibility standards (labels, roles, keyboard support), or leveraging accessible libraries (like Radix/Shadcn) for complex widgets.
Performance: Native HTML + Tailwind has lower runtime overhead than a component library. Chakra UI is built on Emotion (CSS-in-JS) which incurs extra JavaScript at runtime and can increase bundle size​
dhiwise.com
. For performance-critical apps, avoiding the @emotion/styled dependency and its runtime style injection is beneficial. Tailwind’s JIT compiler produces minimal CSS (only the classes used)​
dhiwise.com
, and using plain elements means fewer layers of abstraction. In short, the native+Tailwind approach is faster-loading and leaner than including a large UI framework.
Maintainability & Consistency: Chakra UI provides a consistent theme and ready-made components, which can speed development. However, its “pre-built components might not always align with unique branding” without extra customization​
dhiwise.com
. Maintaining a custom theme in Chakra can become complex. By contrast, using semantic HTML with Tailwind means all styling rules live in one place (the Tailwind config and classes). The team’s comprehensive Tailwind typography scale is a good example of centralized design tokens. This atomic approach promotes consistency (every <button> looks similar) as long as the utility classes are used uniformly. It does require discipline: without a component library, developers must reuse class patterns or build small wrappers to avoid duplicated style code.
Trade-offs: Dropping Chakra UI avoids its performance cost and gives full flexibility, but loses the conveniences of a component library. If rapid prototyping or a heavy emphasis on accessibility (especially complex components like modals, sliders, etc.) is needed, Chakra could accelerate development​
dhiwise.com
. However, since this stack already includes Shadcn UI (see next section), which wraps Radix primitives with accessible behavior, mixing Chakra’s CSS-in-JS with Tailwind might introduce complexity. Generally, stick to one styling paradigm: in this case, Tailwind/TW classes. If an accessible component is needed (dropdowns, menus), use Radix or Shadcn’s versions rather than reintroducing Chakra.
Alternatives: Instead of Chakra, one could use other utility-first or headless libraries. For example, Tailwind UI (official component templates) or Headless UI (prebuilt React components by Tailwind Labs) pair well with Tailwind. Radix UI primitives (used by Shadcn) offer another alternative for complex widgets. These would integrate more smoothly with Tailwind. The key is to avoid mixing conflicting style systems; since Tailwind is primary here, prefer headless or utility-based components over another CSS-in-JS library.
Recommendations: Use semantic HTML with Tailwind classes, and leverage accessible primitives (e.g. Radix/Shadcn) for complex UI. Maintain a component pattern library (even if just simple wrappers) so common patterns (buttons, form controls) are reused with consistent classes. If Chakra UI must be used, consider only its theming provider with custom components; otherwise it’s simpler to remove it entirely, given the chosen stack.
Component Library: Shadcn UI
Overview & Usability: Shadcn UI is a “collection of reusable, accessible components” built with Tailwind CSS and Radix UI primitives​
linkedin.com
. Unlike closed-source frameworks, Shadcn components are copied into your codebase as plain React files, which you can modify freely​
medium.com
​
medium.com
. This means there’s no “big 2MB installation” – you only include the components you need​
medium.com
. In practice, Shadcn provides a modern, consistent look (since components follow Tailwind utility classes) and covers many common UI patterns (buttons, dialogs, cards, etc.). The components are fully themeable and composable. Because they use Radix under the hood, accessibility is baked in. For example, form controls and dialogs follow ARIA best practices automatically​
linkedin.com
.
Performance: Shadcn’s approach has minimal runtime cost. Since you copy the component code into your project, there’s no extra library to import at run-time – the JS bundles only include what you use​
medium.com
. There’s no hidden CSS-in-JS layer, just Tailwind classes and a bit of React. On the other hand, if you copy many components, the total code size increases. However, unused components never ship. In summary, performance is comparable to writing the same components by hand, but accelerated by Shadcn’s templates. This beats some traditional libraries (like MUI or Chakra) which include large base packages and runtime logic.
Accessibility: Shadcn UI is explicitly built on Radix primitives, which are “highly accessible” by design​
linkedin.com
. Each component (menus, tooltips, accordions, etc.) includes the correct roles, keyboard interactions, and screen reader support. This significantly reduces manual a11y work. In other words, even though we’re using our own code, those pieces already follow ARIA best practices. One caution: because Shadcn components use CSS variables for theming, ensure those variables maintain sufficient contrast (you can adjust them in Tailwind config or a theme file). Also, continue to test accessibility (e.g. color contrast, alt text, form labels) across customizations.
Maintainability: Copying code has pros and cons. The pro: you “own” every component, so you can tweak it without waiting on an upstream library. There’s no unexpected breaking changes on library updates. The con: if Shadcn’s source updates or if there’s a bug, you must manually merge fixes. To manage this, use Shadcn’s CLI to re-sync components periodically, or track changes in its GitHub repo. Shadcn’s documentation and active community make troubleshooting easier. Compared to building components from scratch, this approach accelerates development and enforces a cohesive style (since all Shadcn components follow the same design system)​

.
Trade-offs & Alternatives: Shadcn’s “copy-and-own” model is unique; alternatives include Radix UI alone, or component kits like DaisyUI, Tailwind UI, or headless libraries like Headless UI. Radix by itself offers accessibility but no styling – Shadcn fills that gap. Tailwind UI and DaisyUI provide styled components but may not cover all use cases or may impose certain HTML structures. If a more plug-and-play solution is desired, Chakra UI or MUI are options, but we have seen they add bundle weight and use different styling paradigms. Given the Tailwind-based approach here, Shadcn aligns well with the existing stack. Best Practices: Use Shadcn components as templates: install a component (e.g. npx shadcn-ui add button) to get its code, then integrate it. Apply your Tailwind classes consistently (e.g. colors and spacing from your theme). Because Shadcn uses Lucide icons optionally, you can leverage the same Lucide setup across your UI​
linkedin.com
. Treat Shadcn components as the “source of truth” for complex UI pieces – customize them via props (using Class Variance Authority variants) or by editing the JSX. Keep your Tailwind config (colors, fonts, etc.) in sync with Shadcn’s CSS variables to avoid mismatches.
Styling and Typography: Tailwind CSS
Customization & Consistency: Tailwind CSS is a utility-first framework that shines for detailed, responsive design control​
dhiwise.com
​
dhiwise.com
. By defining a comprehensive typographic scale in the Tailwind config (font sizes, line heights, etc.), the team creates a consistent visual rhythm. This centralized scale acts as design tokens – all components use the same type scale and spacing, improving UX coherence. Tailwind’s config file supports custom values easily​
dhiwise.com
. As a result, changing a base font size or color in one place updates the whole app. This makes maintenance easier and prevents drift. Tailwind’s atomic classes (text-lg, font-medium, etc.) ensure styles are explicit in markup and avoid surprises.
Performance: Tailwind’s JIT engine generates only the CSS that’s actually used​
dhiwise.com
. Unused styles are purged in production, keeping CSS payload tiny. This means even a comprehensive scale (e.g. many font-size classes) won’t bloat the stylesheet – only the ones applied in your components end up in the final CSS. Consequently, page rendering is fast and caching is effective. Be sure to configure the content paths correctly so Tailwind purges unused classes and scans your JSX/TSX.
Accessibility: A well-designed typographic scale aids readability. Use relative units (rem) for font sizes so that user preferences (zoom, base font size) carry through. Ensure sufficient line-height (e.g. 1.5×) and letter-spacing for clarity. Tailwind makes it easy to apply responsive type (e.g. text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg). Consider accessibility best practices like using high-contrast text colors (also defined in your Tailwind palette) and testing with screen readers. Tailwind’s official typography plugin can help style rich text (like blog posts or form errors) with accessible spacing.
Maintainability: With Tailwind, the risk is having too many utility classes scattered around. Combat this by: 1) Reusing component wrappers or custom utility classes (@apply in CSS) for complex repeated patterns; 2) Keeping your Tailwind config DRY (only define scales and breakpoints once); 3) Using meaningful class names for color/space utilities (Tailwind’s semantic naming like primary-500) when possible. Regularly audit your CSS bundle to ensure no stale classes. The explicitness of Tailwind classes can actually make maintenance easier, since you see all styles in one place (the markup) rather than jumping through CSS files.
Recommendations: Document your design system (typography, color usage) and enforce it in Tailwind’s config. For example, store fonts in fontFamily, define fontSize steps, and use color names like brand-primary. This ensures all developers use the same values. When combining with Shadcn, align the CSS variables Shadcn uses (e.g. --font-sans) with your Tailwind values. If light/dark mode is needed, leverage Tailwind’s dark variant to flip colors. In summary, Tailwind provides a solid foundation; just keep the utility classes organized through config and reuse.
Integrating Tools: Best Practices and Trade-offs
Consistency Across Tools: Use Tailwind as the common thread. All UI components (native elements, Shadcn components, icons) should be styled via Tailwind classes or theme tokens. Avoid mixing style paradigms: for instance, don’t try to wrap a Chakra Box with Tailwind classes. Since Shadcn is already using Tailwind and Lucide (optionally)​
linkedin.com
, embrace that synergy. Define your color palette, spacing, and typography in the Tailwind config and refer to those tokens everywhere. When using Lucide icons in Shadcn components, ensure icon sizes are consistent with text (e.g. use the same text-xl class for icon and button text). This keeps the UI visually coherent.
Accessibility Integration: Combine the strong points of each tool for ARIA support. Rely on Shadcn/Radix for complex widget accessibility (menus, modals, tooltips), and on semantic HTML for structure (use <nav>, <main>, <section>, etc. where appropriate). Always include alt or labels for icons/buttons as noted earlier​
lucide.dev
. Use automated accessibility linters (like ESLint plugin for JSX a11y) to catch missing labels or roles. Test with browser tools or libraries (axe, Lighthouse) to verify keyboard navigation and ARIA. By blending Shadcn’s primitives with hand-coded HTML, you get rich accessibility coverage.
Performance Considerations: Minimize bundle size by importing only what you need. In practice: import individual Lucide icons and Shadcn components on-demand. For large components (like charts or calendars), consider dynamic import() or code splitting if they’re not on the initial render. Since Tailwind can generate a lot of CSS, ensure its purge settings are correct and enable JIT mode (the modern default). If the project grows, use tools like webpack-bundle-analyzer to check your JS/CSS output. Avoid pulling in multiple UI frameworks: if Chakra is removed, don’t inadvertently introduce MUI or Bootstrap elsewhere. Each extra framework could duplicate CSS or scripts. The current stack (Lucide + Tailwind + Shadcn) should remain lean as long as you follow this selective import practice.
Maintainability & Collaboration: Treat the combination of Tailwind config and Shadcn components as your internal component library. Document how to use/extend components, perhaps in a living style guide or a Storybook. Keep your Tailwind config version-controlled and review changes to it carefully (since it affects the whole app). When Shadcn updates, check their changelog and update components selectively. Consider locking dependencies (using package-lock.json or yarn.lock) and automated updates (Renovate) to stay current but avoid surprises. Enforce code style for Tailwind classes (e.g. run Prettier Tailwind plugin) so that class lists are sorted and consistent. Finally, if you need to mix in plain CSS (e.g. global styles or complex selectors), use Tailwind’s @layer and @apply in a dedicated CSS file to keep things organized.
Summary of Trade-offs and Alternatives
Lucide vs Alternatives: Lucide’s icon set is performant and modern​
uideck.com
​
lucide.dev
. Alternatives like Heroicons or FontAwesome offer more icons or different styles but often at the cost of bundle size or licensing. If project needs more icon variety, Lucide can be supplemented with another light icon set (or use SVG imports). The trade-off is balancing a unified icon style against having every needed symbol.
Native vs Chakra vs Other UI Kits: Native HTML + Tailwind maximizes performance and control, but requires manual work for interactive widgets and accessibility. Chakra UI would reduce that work but adds JS/CSS overhead​
dhiwise.com
​
v2.chakra-ui.com
. Other frameworks (Material UI, Ant Design) similarly bulk up the bundle. Headless libraries (Radix, Headless UI) are lean but require styling effort. The chosen mix (native + Shadcn) is a middle ground: it avoids large dependencies while giving most of the accessibility of a UI library. If productivity becomes an issue, selectively adopting a few Chakra-like components (via Shadcn’s library) can help, since those are statically included and styled by Tailwind.
Tailwind CSS Usage: A full Tailwind utility approach has a learning curve​
dhiwise.com
, and markup can become verbose. Some teams prefer using custom CSS classes or CSS-in-JS for reuse. However, the payoff is smaller CSS and consistent styling. If utility verbosity is a concern, use Tailwind’s @apply for shared patterns (e.g. .btn { @apply px-4 py-2 font-medium }). Alternatives include utility-first frameworks like Windi CSS or UnoCSS, which may offer similar benefits. But Tailwind’s ecosystem (plugins, community, Shadcn integration) makes it a robust choice.
Actionable Recommendations:
Icons: Import Lucide icons individually and style with Tailwind. Always pair icons with proper labels or hidden text​
lucide.dev
.
Components: Continue favoring semantic HTML and Shadcn UI. Only pull in new UI dependencies if absolutely needed.
Styling: Keep all design tokens (colors, spacing, typography) in the Tailwind config for single-point updates​
dhiwise.com
. Use Tailwind’s JIT/purge to optimize CSS.
Accessibility: Leverage Shadcn/Radix for widget behavior. Manually verify any custom UI for ARIA compliance. Automate checks in CI.
Performance: Tree-shake aggressively. Analyze bundles. Remove unused code (e.g. delete any Shadcn component files you don’t use).
Maintainability: Document common UI patterns (e.g. how to create a new Shadcn component or style a card). Use linting/formatting to enforce Tailwind usage. Regularly update dependencies and review release notes for Lucide, Shadcn, and Tailwind.
