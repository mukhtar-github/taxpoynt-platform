# TaxPoynt CRM & POS Integration - Deployment Approach

## Deployment Overview

This document outlines the strategy for deploying the CRM and POS integrations to production, ensuring minimal disruption to existing services while maintaining system stability and security.

## Deployment Phases

### Phase 1: Database Migrations

The database migration will follow TaxPoynt's established multi-step approach:

1. **Pre-check Existing Schema**
   - Validate current database state
   - Backup production database

2. **Create New Tables Without Foreign Keys**
   ```sql
   -- Example migration approach
   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS crm_connections (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
     -- other fields
   );
   
   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS crm_deals (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
     crm_connection_id UUID,
     -- other fields
   );
   ```

3. **Add Foreign Key Constraints Separately**
   ```sql
   -- Add constraints only if both tables exist
   DO $$
   BEGIN
     IF EXISTS (SELECT FROM pg_tables WHERE tablename = 'crm_connections') AND
        EXISTS (SELECT FROM pg_tables WHERE tablename = 'crm_deals') THEN
        
       ALTER TABLE crm_deals 
       ADD CONSTRAINT fk_crm_deals_connection
       FOREIGN KEY (crm_connection_id) 
       REFERENCES crm_connections(id);
     END IF;
   END
   $$;
   ```

4. **Create Partitioned Tables**
   ```sql
   -- Create partitioned tables for high-volume data
   CREATE TABLE pos_transactions (
     -- fields
   ) PARTITION BY RANGE (transaction_timestamp);
   
   -- Create initial partitions
   CREATE TABLE pos_transactions_y2025m06 
   PARTITION OF pos_transactions
   FOR VALUES FROM ('2025-06-01') TO ('2025-07-01');
   ```

### Phase 2: Backend Deployment

1. **Feature Flags Implementation**
   - Deploy code behind feature flags
   - Enable gradual rollout

2. **Service Deployment**
   - Update API services
   - Deploy queue workers
   - Configure Redis cluster

3. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Deploy enhanced Prometheus metrics
   - Set up custom dashboards and alerts

### Phase 3: Frontend Deployment

1. **Component Deployment**
   - Deploy new components to staging
   - Verify UI/UX consistency with platform components

2. **Styling Verification**
   - Ensure proper use of cyan accent colors for platform components
   - Verify Tailwind CSS implementation
   - Confirm no Chakra UI components are used

3. **Production Release**
   - Deploy to production
   - Enable for selected customers

## Infrastructure Requirements

### 1. Database

- PostgreSQL cluster with read replicas
- Automated backup schedule
- Monitoring for query performance

### 2. Queue System

- Redis cluster with persistent storage
- Multiple queue workers by priority
- Monitoring for queue depth and processing time

### 3. API Servers

- Horizontally scalable FastAPI instances
- Load balancing with health checks
- Auto-scaling based on request volume

### 4. Frontend

- Next.js static site generation
- CDN for static assets
- API proxy configuration

## Rollout Strategy

### 1. Internal Testing (Day 1-2)

- Deploy to internal testing environment
- QA team verification of all flows
- Fix critical issues

### 2. Beta Customer Access (Day 3-5)

- Enable access for 5-10 selected customers
- Collect feedback and monitor performance
- Address any issues discovered

### 3. Gradual Rollout (Day 6-10)

- Enable for 25% of customers
- Monitor system performance
- Gradually increase to 100% over 5 days

## Rollback Plan

### Triggers for Rollback

- Error rate exceeding 1%
- Processing time exceeding SLAs
- Critical security vulnerability
- Data integrity issues

### Rollback Procedure

1. **Disable Feature Flags**
   - Turn off access to new integration features
   - Redirect traffic to previous implementation

2. **Database Rollback**
   - Execute rollback migrations if needed
   - Restore from backup if necessary

3. **Code Rollback**
   - Deploy previous version of services
   - Revert frontend changes

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Monitor

- Transaction processing time
- API response time
- Error rate by integration type
- Queue depth and processing time
- Database query performance

### Alerting Thresholds

- Critical: POS transaction processing >3s
- Critical: API error rate >2%
- Warning: Queue depth >1000 items
- Warning: Database query time >500ms

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Database backup completed
- [ ] Migration scripts tested in staging
- [ ] Feature flags implemented
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards created
- [ ] Alert thresholds configured
- [ ] Rollback plan reviewed
- [ ] Support team trained
- [ ] Documentation updated

This deployment approach ensures a safe and controlled release of the CRM and POS integration features while minimizing risk to existing services and customers.
