# ISO/IEC 27001 certification is mandatory for PEPPOL Access Point providers.
Peppol requires that Access Point Providers have ISO 27001 certification - an information security standard that ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.

## ISO/IEC 27001 Certification Overview:

### What It Is:
- An international standard for Information Security Management Systems (ISMS)
- Demonstrates that your organization has robust security controls to protect data
- The ISO certification is a badge showing that a product or service is of high quality, reliable, and safe

### Why PEPPOL Requires It:
- Ensures Access Points can securely handle sensitive business documents
- Protects the integrity of the entire PEPPOL network
- Builds trust among all network participants

## Getting ISO 27001 Certified:

### 1. **Preparation Phase** (3-6 months):
- Conduct gap analysis of current security practices
- Develop Information Security Management System (ISMS)
- Create required documentation:
  - Information Security Policy
  - Risk Assessment procedures
  - Business Continuity plans
  - Access Control policies
  - Incident Response procedures

### 2. **Implementation** (2-4 months):
- Implement security controls across your organization
- Train staff on security procedures
- Conduct internal audits
- Perform management reviews

### 3. **Certification Process** (1-2 months):
- **Stage 1 Audit**: Documentation review
- **Stage 2 Audit**: On-site assessment of implementation
- Receive certification if successful

### 4. **Maintenance**:
- Annual surveillance audits
- Full recertification every 3 years

## Certification Bodies in Nigeria:

You'll need an accredited certification body. Some options that operate in Nigeria include:
- BSI (British Standards Institution)
- SGS
- Bureau Veritas
- TÜV SÜD
- Lloyd's Register

## Costs to Consider:

1. **Certification fees**: $5,000 - $20,000 (depending on company size)
2. **Consultant fees** (optional): $10,000 - $50,000
3. **Internal costs**: Staff time, system upgrades, documentation
4. **Annual surveillance audits**: $2,000 - $5,000

## Timeline Considerations:

Given Nigeria's PEPPOL timeline:
- **July 2025**: Pilot phase begins
- **January 2026**: Full rollout

You should start the ISO 27001 process **immediately** as it typically takes 6-12 months total.

## Tips for Success:

1. **Start with a gap analysis** - understand what you already have vs. what's needed
2. **Consider hiring a consultant** - especially if this is your first ISO certification
3. **Use ISO 27001 software tools** - they can streamline documentation and compliance
4. **Integrate with existing systems** - don't create separate security processes
5. **Focus on real security**, not just compliance - this benefits your business beyond PEPPOL

## Alternative Approach:

If time is tight, some organizations:
- Partner with an already ISO 27001 certified company initially
- Work on their own certification in parallel
- Transition to independent operation once certified

Would you like me to search for specific ISO 27001 consultants or certification bodies operating in Nigeria, or would you prefer more details about any particular aspect of the certification process?
