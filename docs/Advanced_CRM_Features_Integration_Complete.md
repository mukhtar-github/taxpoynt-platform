### Import Structure
```python
# Added to app/main.py imports
from app.routes import advanced_crm_features

# Added to app/routes/crm_integrations.py imports  
from app.integrations.crm.data_mapper import cross_platform_mapper
from app.integrations.crm.template_engine import template_engine
from app.integrations.crm.pipeline_tracker import get_pipeline_tracker
```

### Router Registration
```python
# Added to app/main.py router inclusion
app.include_router(advanced_crm_features.router, prefix=settings.API_V1_STR, tags=["advanced-crm-features"])
```

## API Endpoints Summary
