# e-invoice-api – Incremental Implementation Plan

This document outlines a day-by-day delivery plan for standing up the new **e-invoice-api** repository using the provided DDD-friendly scaffold. Each task group is sized so it can be tackled in its own feature branch (e.g., `feat/<module-name>`), reviewed via PR, and merged independently.

The plan assumes we are migrating capabilities from the existing `platform/backend` codebase into the new structure while modernising around the new boundaries.

---

## Guiding Principles
- **DDD alignment:** Keep bounded contexts (invoicing, compliance, onboarding) isolated; domain logic lives in `contexts/<context>/domain`.
- **Foundation first:** Phases 0–3 must leave a production-ready skeleton (settings, security, middleware, DB/migrations, CI) before any context work merges.
- **Incremental vertical slices:** Each branch delivers a cohesive slice—domain → application → infrastructure → API—with passing tests and docs.
- **Shared services early:** Messaging, observability, and background job scaffolds should exist before contexts depend on them.
- **Platform compatibility checklist:** Every merge checks auth/tenant hooks, observability metrics, messaging, and migrations.
- **Configuration-first:** Secrets remain out of repo; use `config/settings.example.env` + Pydantic Settings for environment parity.
- **Telemetry/security parity:** Carry across JWT, permission guards, observability hooks from the source repo early in the migration.
- **Testing mirrors structure:** Unit tests under `tests/unit/...`, integration/end-to-end under `tests/integration` and `tests/e2e`.

---

## Phase 0 – Preparation (Day 0)
**Branch:** `feat/bootstrap-repo`
- Initialise repository using scaffold (directories, placeholder files, `.editorconfig`, `.gitignore`, `pyproject.toml` with tooling stub).
- Add CONTRIBUTING + ADR template in `docs/`.
- Set up base CI workflow (`infra/ci/github-actions.yaml`) running lint + tests.
- Provide README baseline covering project purpose, architecture, branch strategy.
- Acceptance:
  - `uv/poetry/pip install` (or chosen tool) works.
  - `pytest` (empty) + `ruff`/`black`/`mypy` placeholders pass.

---

## Phase 1 – Platform Core (Days 1–2)
### Day 1 – Settings & Infrastructure Primitives
**Branch:** `feat/core-settings`

- Tests: unit tests for settings loader (env precedence, default values).

### Day 2 – Security & Auth Foundations
**Branch:** `feat/core-security`

## Branch Workflow Summary
1. `git checkout -b feat/<task-name>`
2. Implement scoped changes + tests.
3. Update docs/ADR if architectural impact.

This plan can be adjusted as we learn more during migration, but following the phases ensures the new API evolves in well-tested, reviewable increments that respect the DDD scaffold. Adapt the daily cadence as team capacity dictates while keeping branch scopes tight and observable.
