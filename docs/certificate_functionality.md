# Purpose of Certificates in the System

The certificates in the TaxPoynt eInvoice system are not issued by the system itself. Rather, they're securely stored and managed by the system for several critical security requirements:

### 1. FIRS Compliance & Invoice Signing
The Nigerian Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) requires electronic invoices to be digitally signed with a Cryptographic Stamp Identifier (CSID). This signature proves the authenticity and integrity of each invoice. The system needs to:
- Store X.509 digital certificates provided by FIRS or other authorized bodies
- Use these certificates to cryptographically sign invoices
- Validate certificates to ensure they haven't expired or been revoked

### 2. Secure Communication with FIRS
When submitting invoices to the FIRS API:
- TLS client certificates may be required for mutual authentication
- The system needs to securely store these certificates and use them for API calls

### 3. Data Protection & Compliance
Under NDPR (Nigeria Data Protection Regulation) requirements, sensitive data must be protected:
- The certificate system allows encryption of configuration data
- It enables secure storage of API credentials
- It supports the "Secure Authentication and Authorization" core feature

### 4. CSID Implementation
The "CSID implementation for invoice signing" mentioned in your core features directly uses this certificate system. Each invoice requires a cryptographic signature that:
- Proves its authenticity
- Prevents tampering
- Links it to a specific taxpayer
- Meets regulatory requirements

### Who Provides These Certificates?
The certificates are typically:
- Provided by FIRS for official invoice signing
- Issued by certificate authorities for secure communications
- In some cases, generated by organizations for their internal use

The system doesn't issue certificates - instead, it securely manages certificates issued by authorized bodies, keeping them encrypted and making them available for secure operations like invoice signing and API authentication.

This certificate management system directly supports several of your core requirements, particularly those related to FIRS compliance, invoice signing, and security requirements.
