# Day 7 Release Notes – Onboarding Validation & Handoff

## Highlights

- ✅ Added `platform/tests/integration/test_onboarding_regression.py` to cover the full sign-up → verification → checklist sequence, including analytics assertions for `si_onboarding.email_verified` and `si_onboarding.terms_confirmed`.
- ✅ Introduced a regression guard ensuring legacy nine-step identifiers (e.g., `organization_setup`, `compliance_verification`) are canonicalised to the new wizard flow before persistence.
- ✅ Refreshed onboarding UX copy: verification CTAs and checklist messaging now reference the “Verify account” milestone once analytics confirms completion.
- ✅ Documentation updates:
  - `docs/si_onboarding_api_audit_day2.md` now captures the Day 7 validation summary and telemetry alignment.
  - `docs/si_onboarding_ux_day1.md` records the final copy tweaks for the verification step and checklist highlighting.

## Validation Summary

- `pytest -q platform/tests/integration/test_onboarding_regression.py`
- Unit regression safety nets remain green (`pytest -q platform/tests/unit/test_auth_registration_verification_contracts.py platform/tests/unit/test_onboarding_endpoints_contracts.py`)
- Telemetry hooks inspected during test execution to confirm analytics batches are emitted via the message router.

## Action Items

- Keep the analytics dashboard pointed at the new event names for funnel tracking.
- Coordinate with frontend to replay the new copy in the Vercel deployment.
- Schedule a dry run of the automated regression prior to release.
