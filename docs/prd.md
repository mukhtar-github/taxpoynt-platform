##Product Requirements Document (PRD)
### Overview
This document outlines the requirements for an integration platform for System Integrators (SIs) to connect with the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) e-invoicing system in Nigeria. It aims to simplify and streamline the integration process, ensuring compliance and enhancing efficiency.

### Objectives
- Provide a user-friendly interface for SIs to manage integrations with FIRS-MBS.
- Ensure secure and compliant data exchange.
- Automate invoice validation and submission to reduce errors.
- Offer real-time monitoring and reporting for performance tracking.

### Target Audience
The primary users are System Integrators (SIs) who need to integrate their clients' accounting systems with FIRS-MBS.

### Features
Key features include:
- Secure user authentication and authorization.
- Tools for setting up and configuring integrations.
- Automated generation of unique Invoice Reference Numbers (IRNs).
- Pre-submission invoice validation against FIRS standards.
- Data encryption for secure transmission.
- A dashboard for monitoring integration status and accessing reports.

### Success Criteria
- Achieve at least 95% success rate for integrations.
- Reduce average integration setup time to under 2 hours.
- Maintain 99.9% system uptime.
- Reach a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of at least 70.
- Ensure zero compliance violations reported by FIRS.

### Constraints and Assumptions
- Must comply with FIRS standards and use specified tech stack (NextJS, TypeScript, FastAPI, etc.).
- Initial deployment on Railway, scaling to AWS.
- Assumes FIRS provides necessary APIs and SIs have technical capability.

The PRD is the foundation, outlining the product's purpose, goals, and features. Given the context, the application aims to simplify SIs' integration with FIRS-MBS, ensuring compliance with Nigerian tax regulations.
The document includes:
- **Introduction**: Describes the platform as an integration tool for SIs, focusing on streamlining processes and ensuring compliance.
- **Objectives**: Includes providing a user-friendly interface, secure data exchange, automated validation, and real-time monitoring. These align with the need to reduce errors and save time, as highlighted in the FIRS consultation document's emphasis on efficiency and transparency.
- **Target Audience**: Primarily SIs, who manage integrations for clients, as per the stakeholder engagement details.
- **Features**: Detailed in the thinking trace, these include authentication, integration management, IRN generation, invoice validation, data encryption, and a dashboard. Must-have features focus on core functionality, while nice-to-haves like analytics are considered for future expansion.
- **User Stories**: Examples include registration, integration setup, and monitoring, reflecting the operational needs of SIs as outlined in the onboarding guide.
- **Success Criteria**: Measurable goals like 95% integration success rate and 99.9% uptime are set, drawing from the need to ensure reliability and user satisfaction, as seen in the FIRS system's phased rollout strategy.
- **Constraints and Assumptions**: Notes compliance with FIRS standards, specified tech stack, and deployment platforms, with assumptions like reliable internet connectivity, reflecting the technical challenges mentioned in the analysis.
- **Timeline**: Briefly mentions a phased approach (POC, Prototype, MVP), with details deferred to the Implementation Plan, ensuring alignment with the 6-month timeline proposed.
