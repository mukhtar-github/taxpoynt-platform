# IRN Generation

Based on the information about Nigeria's FIRS MBS (Merchant Buyer Solution) e-invoicing system, **it is FIRS's responsibility to generate the IRN (Invoice Reference Number)**, not the service providers.

Here's how it works:

The e-invoicing system automatically generates the IRN. This means that when businesses submit their invoices to the FIRS platform for validation and clearance, the FIRS system itself creates the unique Invoice Reference Number.

The role of service providers (System Integrators and Application Service Providers) is to:

- Help businesses integrate with the FIRS e-invoicing platform
- Facilitate the submission of invoice data to FIRS
- Enable connectivity between business systems and the FIRS platform

Service providers will be required to be accredited by the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA). Their function is essentially to act as intermediaries that help businesses connect to and communicate with the FIRS system, but the actual IRN generation happens within the FIRS e-invoicing platform itself.

Cleared invoices receive an Invoice Reference Number (IRN) and cryptographic stamp marking them as authentic. This confirmation process, including IRN generation and digital stamping, is performed by the FIRS system after receiving the invoice data through the service providers.
