# Invoice Processing

Based on the comprehensive requirements and business model in your documents, I'll outline the UI/UX design approach for your combined SI + APP e-invoicing platform. Let me break this down into digestible parts:

## Part 1: Landing Page & Business Presence

**Key Sections:**

1. **Hero Section**

```
