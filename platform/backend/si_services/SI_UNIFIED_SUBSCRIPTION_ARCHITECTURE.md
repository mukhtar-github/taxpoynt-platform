# üéØ SI Unified Subscription Architecture - Implementation Guide

## üìã Core Principle

**TaxPoynt SI operates on a UNIFIED SUBSCRIPTION MODEL where one tier price provides access to ALL business system integrations at the corresponding capability level.**

---

## üèóÔ∏è Unified Subscription Model

### **Single Tier = Complete Platform Access**

‚úÖ **Customers pay ONE price and get access to EVERYTHING at their tier level**
- No separate payments for ERP vs Open Banking vs Logistics
- No √† la carte pricing for individual integrations
- No separate billing for different business system categories

### **Tier Differentiation by Capability, Not Service Type**

| Tier | Monthly Price | **What You Get** |
|------|---------------|------------------|
| **STARTER** | $50 | **Basic versions** of ALL integrations |
| **PROFESSIONAL** | $200 | **Advanced versions** of ALL integrations |
| **ENTERPRISE** | $800 | **Enterprise versions** of ALL integrations |  
| **SCALE** | $2,000 | **Scale versions** of ALL integrations |

## üí° Business Logic & Implementation Principles

### **1. Unified Usage Limits Apply Across ALL Services**

```python
# Example: STARTER tier with 1,000 invoice limit
STARTER_MONTHLY_LIMITS = {
    "total_invoices_processed": 1000,  # Combined across ALL integrations
    "erp_transactions": "included_in_total",
    "banking_transactions": "included_in_total", 
    "ecommerce_orders": "included_in_total",
    "logistics_shipments": "included_in_total"
}
```

**Key Point**: Customer gets 1,000 total invoices, NOT 1,000 per integration type.

### **2. Feature Access by Capability Level**

```python
TIER_CAPABILITIES = {
    "STARTER": {
        "integration_type": "basic",
        "real_time_sync": False,
        "bulk_operations": False,
        "custom_workflows": False,
        "webhooks": False,
        "api_rate_limit": "100/min"
    },
    "PROFESSIONAL": {
        "integration_type": "advanced", 
        "real_time_sync": True,
        "bulk_operations": True,
        "custom_workflows": False,
        "webhooks": True,
        "api_rate_limit": "500/min"
    },
    "ENTERPRISE": {
        "integration_type": "enterprise",
        "real_time_sync": True,
        "bulk_operations": True, 
        "custom_workflows": True,
        "webhooks": True,
        "api_rate_limit": "2000/min"
    },
    "SCALE": {
        "integration_type": "unlimited",
        "real_time_sync": True,
        "bulk_operations": True,
        "custom_workflows": True,
        "webhooks": True,
        "api_rate_limit": "10000/min"
    }
}
```

### **3. Progressive Enhancement Architecture**

Higher tiers unlock MORE SOPHISTICATED versions of the SAME integrations:

- **STARTER ‚Üí PROFESSIONAL**: Adds real-time sync, webhooks, bulk operations
- **PROFESSIONAL ‚Üí ENTERPRISE**: Adds custom workflows, white-labeling, priority processing  
- **ENTERPRISE ‚Üí SCALE**: Adds unlimited scalability, SLA guarantees, dedicated support

## üéØ Implementation Guide-Rails

### **For All Future SI Service Development:**

#### ‚úÖ **DO: Implement Tier-Based Capabilities**
```python
@require_si_tier("erp_integration")  # Available in ALL tiers
async def connect_basic_erp():
    pass

@require_si_tier("erp_advanced_integration")  # PROFESSIONAL+ only  
async def connect_advanced_erp_with_webhooks():
    pass

@require_si_tier("erp_custom_integration")  # ENTERPRISE+ only
async def create_custom_erp_connector():
    pass
```

#### ‚úÖ **DO: Use Unified Usage Tracking**
```python
# Record usage against total invoice limit
await record_si_usage(
    organization_id, 
    SIUsageType.INVOICES_PROCESSED,  # Unified metric
    1,
    metadata={"source": "erp_sap", "integration_type": "basic"}
)
```

#### ‚ùå **DON'T: Create Separate Service Billing**
```python
# WRONG - Don't bill separately for different service types
erp_subscription = await get_erp_subscription(org_id)  # ‚ùå
banking_subscription = await get_banking_subscription(org_id)  # ‚ùå

# RIGHT - Use unified SI subscription  
si_subscription = await get_si_subscription(org_id)  # ‚úÖ
```

#### ‚ùå **DON'T: Create Service-Specific Usage Limits**
```python
# WRONG - Separate limits per service type
"erp_invoice_limit": 1000,  # ‚ùå
"banking_invoice_limit": 1000,  # ‚ùå  
"ecommerce_invoice_limit": 1000,  # ‚ùå

# RIGHT - Unified limit across all services
"total_invoice_limit": 1000,  # ‚úÖ
```
