That’s a sharp question — and you’re right to probe it.

Strictly speaking, **invoices don’t “originate” from banking activity** — they’re **commercial documents** issued by a seller to a buyer, usually before or during payment, not by a bank.

However, the phrase in your code —

“Best when invoices originate from banking activity or reconciliations.”

— can make sense **if you’re referring to a data integration context**, like what your TaxPoynt or Mono-based systems do. Here’s the nuance:

# **✅ When the phrase makes sense**

It can be understood as:

*“Best when invoice data is reconstructed or triggered from transaction records (bank feeds) during reconciliation.”*

In other words:

•	The **bank transaction feed** provides payment records.

•	Your system then **matches or infers invoices** based on these transactions — for example, when reconciling payments with vendor/customer references.

•	This means invoices are **derived from or linked to** banking data, not literally created by the bank.

# **💡 Better wording**

To make it technically clearer and still marketing-friendly, you could say:

•	“Best when invoice data is derived from banking transactions or reconciliations.”

•	“Best for businesses that reconcile invoices directly from bank feeds.”

•	“Ideal when syncing invoices from transaction data during reconciliation.”

Would you like me to reword the whole **laneCards** array text for better clarity and product-style tone (keeping it concise and professional)?
