# Migration Testing Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a systematic approach to verifying that migrated components from Chakra UI to Tailwind CSS maintain their functionality, appearance, and accessibility. The testing plan aims to identify issues early in the migration process and provide guidance for fixing them.

## Testing Objectives

1. **Functional equivalence** - Ensure migrated components work the same as their predecessors
2. **Visual consistency** - Maintain visual design and user experience during migration
3. **Responsive behavior** - Verify components respond appropriately across device sizes
4. **Accessibility** - Confirm accessibility features are preserved or improved
5. **Performance** - Monitor and prevent performance regressions

## Testing Approach

### 1. Component-level Testing

Each migrated component should undergo these tests:

| Test Type | Description | Method |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Prop matching | Verify all props from the Chakra component are supported | Manual inspection |
| Event handling | Confirm click, hover, focus events work as expected | Interactive testing |
| Styling | Compare styling between old and new components | Visual inspection |
| Edge cases | Test with extreme values, empty states, errors | Targeted test cases |

#### Checklist for Component Testing:

- [ ] Component renders correctly with default props
- [ ] Component accepts and responds to all required props
- [ ] Styling matches the Chakra UI equivalent
- [ ] Hover/focus/active states work correctly
- [ ] Component responds correctly to user interaction
- [ ] Error states display correctly
- [ ] Animation transitions are preserved

### 2. Page-level Testing

After components are migrated, test complete pages to ensure coherent integration:

| Test Area | Description | Method |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Layout | Check overall layout remains consistent | Visual inspection |
| Interactions | Test user flows involving multiple components | Manual testing |
| Responsiveness | Verify page layout at mobile, tablet, desktop sizes | Browser resizing |
| Integration | Confirm components work together correctly | User flow testing |

#### Checklist for Page Testing:

- [ ] Page layout matches original design
- [ ] User flows work end-to-end
- [ ] Page responds correctly at all breakpoints
- [ ] No visual glitches between components
- [ ] Page load time is acceptable

### 3. Accessibility Testing

Validate that accessibility is maintained or improved:

| Test Area | Description | Method |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Keyboard navigation | Test focus order and keyboard shortcuts | Manual testing |
| Screen reader compatibility | Verify ARIA roles and labels | Screen reader testing |
| Color contrast | Check for WCAG 2.1 compliance | Contrast checker tools |
| Text scaling | Test with increased font sizes | Browser zoom testing |

#### Checklist for Accessibility Testing:

- [ ] All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- [ ] Focus indicators are visible
- [ ] Proper semantic HTML is used
- [ ] ARIA attributes are implemented correctly
- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards
- [ ] Text remains readable when scaled up to 200%

## Testing Tools

1. **Browser DevTools** - For visual inspection and responsive testing
2. **Lighthouse** - For performance and accessibility audits
3. **Axe DevTools** - For in-depth accessibility testing
4. **React Testing Library** - For component unit tests
5. **Jest** - For running automated tests
6. **Cypress** - For end-to-end testing

## Testing Process

### Before Migration

1. Document current component behavior and appearance
2. Create baseline screenshots at multiple breakpoints
3. Note any existing issues that should not be replicated

### During Migration

1. Test individual components as they're migrated
2. Address issues immediately before proceeding
3. Document any intentional changes in behavior or appearance

### After Migration

1. Conduct full page testing across all pages
2. Perform cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
3. Run accessibility audits
4. Test on actual devices (not just emulators)

## Regression Testing

After all migration is complete, conduct regression testing:

1. Test all critical user flows
2. Verify all forms still submit correctly
3. Check that authentication flows work
4. Validate API integrations function as expected

## Documentation

For each migrated component:

1. Document any changes in the component API
2. Note any behavior changes or improvements
3. Update usage examples in documentation
4. Add testing notes for future reference

## Test Case Examples

### Example: Button Component

```jsx
// Testing different states
<Button variant="default">Default Button</Button>
<Button variant="primary" disabled>Disabled Button</Button>
<Button variant="outline" size="sm">Small Outline Button</Button>
<Button variant="destructive" size="lg">Large Destructive Button</Button>

// Testing with icons
<Button variant="ghost" leftIcon={<Icon />}>Left Icon</Button>
<Button variant="link" rightIcon={<Icon />}>Right Icon</Button>
```

### Example: Form Component

```jsx
// Testing form validation
<FormField 
  label="Username" 
  htmlFor="username"
  required
  error={errors.username}
  errorMessage="Username is required"
>
  <Input id="username" />
</FormField>

// Testing different form states
<Form isLoading={true} />
<Form isDisabled={true} />
<Form isSubmitted={true} />
```

## Bug Tracking

Use a consistent format for reporting issues:

```
Component: [Name]
Issue: [Description]
Expected: [What should happen]
Actual: [What is happening]
Steps to reproduce: [Numbered list]
Severity: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
```

## Conclusion

This testing plan provides a structured approach to ensure that the migration from Chakra UI to Tailwind CSS maintains or improves the quality, functionality, and appearance of the Taxpoynt eInvoice application. Following this plan will help identify issues early and ensure a smooth transition for users.
