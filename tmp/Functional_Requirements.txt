           Functional Requirements
           Requirements
           The functional requirements define expectations for the implementation of the new e-
           Collections model and have been ranked in order of priority as follows:

             Level of Priority
                                     Description
             (MoSCoW)

             Must have               Proposed solution must have this requirement to meet the business needs.

                                     Proposed solution should have this requirement, if possible, but project
             Should have
                                     success does not rely on it.

                                     Proposed solution could have this requirement if it does not affect anything
             Could have
                                     else in the project.

                                     Would like to have this requirement later on the proposed solution, but it
             Won’t have
                                     won’t be delivered this time.
